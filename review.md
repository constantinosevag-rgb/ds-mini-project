# Review for the DS1 mini-project
## Reproducibility report:
The analyisis is reproductible, no issues. Requirements are defined in the requirements.txt.
## Overall opinion:
Code is clean, simple, instructions are easy to follow. The project documentation is clear and easy to understand. Use of Git is very good. There are only a few minor suggestions which I listed below.
## Suggested improvements:
1. You can use simply "df" instead of "print(df)" when printing out the dataset for preview.
2. When you compute and print out the average GDP, for clarity you should add the measurement unit (eg. USD, EUR or something else) for the value.
3. You should link the source of the dataset and also write out which year the dataset refers to and what is the exact indicator? Is it GDP per capita?
